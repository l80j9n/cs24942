Key Literature  Background Reading 
Personal Background To   start   considering   the   development   of   the   tool   of   text-based   adventure   games,   I   first   needed   an   understanding of the content and structure of text-based games, which I gained during my second-year   C++ course. At that time,   I   used   C++ to develop   a   battle   system   for   a   Console-Based   Adventure   Game   and   added   a   map,   enemies, and   items   as well. The experience from   this   assignment will   help   me   better   understand this   project. Additionally, as   I   have experience   using the   Unity   engine,   and   Unity   itself offers   many convenient features, therefore, this   project will   be developed   based on   Unity.
Core Concepts  Project Focus Text-based   adventure   games,   also   known   as   Interactive   Fiction   (IF),   one   of   the   most   famous   series   is Zork,   developed   by Infocom [1].   Montfort, in Twisty Little Passages [2],   points   out   that   the   primary   difference between IF and   traditional narratives lies in its non-linear and multi-layered narrative   structure.   Interactive   Fiction   not   only   allows   players   to   make   choices   but   also   creates   multiple   possibilities within   the   narrative through those choices. The storytelling aspect   is not   limited   to   linear   progression;   rather,   it   relies on   players' decisions to   impel. Based on this theory,the branching logic of the tool can provide users with an intuitive interface, allowing   them to easily set   up various scenarios and   paths.   On the   other   hand,   a   functional   module   that   enables   users   to   add   critical   plot   points   and   interactive   options   ensures   that   the   stories   they   create   are   rich   in   interactivity   and   impact. This   modular   design   allows   users to set   different   plot   developments   based   on   players   ’ choices, enhancing the   immersion of the story.
Design Principles Interactivity   is crucial   in game design, and   this   can   also   be   incorporated   into   the   design   of   a   text-based   adventure game tool. A   user-friendly design tool can   guide   creators   to   focus   on   game   interactivity   and   make   their   development   more   efficient.   During   researching,   I   discovered several   text-based   adventure   game tools created by others, which also follow certain game design principles. Rules of Play emphasizes   that   "game   mechanics   can   be   divided   into   independent   modules,   allowing   different   game   elements to   collaborate and create diverse interactions" [3]. Quest, designed by Warren [4], adopts a modular design   approach,   called   command   editing   interface, which   is   used   to   define   and   edit   commands,   objects,   and   scenes   within   the   game,   allowing   creators   to   manage   these   elements   individually.   Through   modular   design,    creators    can    break      down    complex    game      interactions      into      manageable      parts.    Additionally,   “meaningful choices”   is another   key   impression   in   interactive design, where players' choices   should   lead   to   different   consequences,   providing   a   sense   of   control   and   immersion   [3].   In   the   tool,   this   can   be   achieved   through   a   branching   narrative   tree,   enabling   creators   to   design   different   plot   directions   or   endings   for   each    player   choice.   The TextAdventureToolkit,   developed    by    Filer    [5],    uses    a   flowchart   interface to script. stories. Thus,   this   tool   will   combine   both   approaches:   modular   design   for   characters,   objects,   and   scenes,   allowing   creators   to   edit   each    element    individually;    and   a   flowchart   for   story   progression and   player choices, giving creators a   more   intuitive way   to   design   player   choice   paths.
AI Integration and LLM Application Previous   research   has shown that AI can accomplish three   tasks   in   games:   play   a   game,   design   a   game,   and   model the   human players   [6].   Large   Language   Models (LLMs) are often presented   as   conversational   agents   and   writing   assistants,   making   them   well-suited   for   the   development   of   text-based   adventure   games.   Therefore,   this   project   will   utilize   the   ChatGPT   API   to   assist   creators   in   game   development.   Additionally,    LLMs    can    act    as    game    analysts    [7],    simulating    and    analyzing    player    experiences    and   behaviors.    The    integration      of    AI      will      help      creators      better      understand      player      perspectives      during   development.
Multiplayer Functionality Developing multiplayer functionality will be one of the most challenging   aspects   of this   project,   as   I   have      limited   prior   knowledge   of   multiplayer   text-based   adventure   games   and   no   experience   in   developing      multiplayer features.   However, through   research,   I   found that   Unity   released Netcodefor GameObjects in   July   2024   [8],   whic代 写Develop a tool that enables users to create their own text-based adventure gamesC/C++
代做程序编程语言h   can   enable   multiplayer   functionality. Additionally,   a   third-party   package, Mirror [9],   is considered a viable alternative   if Netcodefor GameObjects is   not suitable.
Development Process  Method Since    I    have    a    clear    goal    for    the   Adventure    Game    Creator    (Text-Based)    tool   and   will    be   working   independently, I plan to use an Incremental   Development approach. This method   allows   me to   gradually   build, test, and   refine   individual features   until the tool fully   meets   my   aims   and   objectives.   The   progress   will   be simple and flexible.I will start   by creating a   basic   prototype with   essential features   and   continuously   refine   it   through   cycles   of testing and improvement. Once the tool achieves the desired functionality, I will finalize   it into the final   product.
The   user   interface   and   the   system   to   create   game   elements   and   game   logic   are   defined   as   the   basic   function. And the AI   implementation and   Multiplayer   Functionality are the advanced   ones.
For development,   I will   use   Unity3D as the   main   platform. with C# for   programming.   For version   control,   I will use GitHub to maintain backups of each iteration,   along with   regular   physical   backups   in   my   laptop.
Data Sources In this   project,   I will   use the   open-source   ConvAI   dataset   [10] to   assist   in   generating   dialogue for   NPCs   within the text-based adventure game creation tool. This dataset provides a variety   of dialogue   patterns   and   responses,   helping   the   tool   generate   natural   and   engaging   NPC   interactions,   which   enhance   the   immersion of the   user-created game worlds.
Testing  Evaluation Due to my choice of an incremental development process, unit tests will   be conducted after   each feature   is   developed   to verify   its functionality.   Regression   tests will   be   performed   in subsequent   increments   to   ensure that the addition of   new features does   not   impact the   performance   of   existing   ones.
Test Tool Selection:   I   am   currently   researching   testing   tools   suitable   for   C#   and   Unity3D.   The   initial   selections   include:
NUnit[11]: A commonly used C# unit testing framework, ideal for verifying   the correctness of game logic   and functions.
UnityTest Framework[12]:   Unity’s built-in testing framework, which can be used for   integration tests   on   scripts and components   in the game to   ensure   module compatibility.
Play ModeTests[13]:   Designed to test the game’s actual   runtime experience, ensuring stability   and   that   user experience   meets expectations.During   development,   I   will   experiment   with   these   tools   and   select   the   most   suitable   option   based   on      project   needs.   Extensive   testing   will   be   required   to   ensure   the   proper   functioning   of   game   logic   and      event triggers, such as item pickups, quest initiation, and room transitions, to meet with user expectations.UI and Performance Testing: After completing all features,   I will perform. UI   and   performance testing to   ensure   the   tool’s   interface   is   smooth   and   user-friendly.   These   tests   will   help   confirm   that   the   tool   is   technically feasible and   meets the   project’s   requirements.

This   tool   provides   creators   with   a   low-barrier   way   to   realize   their   interactive   stories,   meeting current   practical   needs and trends   in game creation   and   education.
Ability to Independently Manage a Major Project This   project   is   independently   managed   by   me,   following   an    incremental   development   approach   to   ensure   clear   goals and schedules at   each stage.   I will   strictly   follow   the   project   plan,   conducting   regular   reviews and adjustments to ensure on-time delivery   and   adherence   to   expected   standards.
Critical Self-Evaluation of the Process Throughout each stage of project development,   I will conduct self-evaluations,   particularly   reflecting   on   the   development   approach   and   the   effectiveness   of   feature   implementations   to   identify   improvement   opportunities. After   project   completion,   I will   perform. a final self-evaluation to   summarize   the   project's   successes and   lessons   learned,   providing valuable experience for future   projects.Through    these    approaches,      this       project    will      comprehensively       meet    the      six       BCS       project      criteria,      demonstrating not only my technical capabilities but also my qualities in innovation, project management,   and self-assessment.
